## Step 2: Install Crysis 2 Objects Pak
 
Once you have extracted the files, you need to copy them to your Crysis 2 game folder. The game folder is usually located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Crytek\Crysis 2\ or C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Crysis 2\. You can also find it by right-clicking on the game icon on your desktop or in your Steam library and selecting Properties > Local Files > Browse.
 
Inside the game folder, you will see a folder called GameCrysis2. This is where you need to paste the mod files. You can either overwrite the existing files or create a backup copy of them before installing the mod. The mod files include:
 
- A folder called Objects that contains all the new objects and props.
- A file called pakobjects.pak that contains the textures and sounds for the new objects.
- A file called pakobjects.xml that contains the information and settings for the new objects.

After copying the files, you are done with the installation. You can now launch the game and enjoy the new objects.
 
## Step 3: Use Crysis 2 Objects Pak
 
To use the new objects in the game, you need to access the Sandbox Editor. The Sandbox Editor is a tool that allows you to create and edit maps and scenarios for Crysis 2. You can access it by launching the game with the -devmode parameter. To do this, you need to create a shortcut of the game executable (Crysis2.exe) on your desktop or in your Steam library, right-click on it and select Properties, and add -devmode at the end of the Target field. For example:
 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Crytek\Crysis 2\bin32\Crysis2.exe -devmode
 
Then, double-click on the shortcut to launch the game in developer mode. You will see a console window appear on your screen. Type "ed" (without quotes) in the console window and press Enter. This will open the Sandbox Editor.
 
In the Sandbox Editor, you can create a new map or load an existing one. To add a new object from Crysis 2 Objects Pak, you need to go to RollupBar > Entity > Misc > ObjectPak. Here you will see a list of categories and subcategories of objects that you can choose from. For example:

- Vehicles: Cars, Trucks, Bikes, Boats, Helicopters, etc.
- Weapons: Guns, Grenades, Mines, Rockets, etc.
- Furniture: Chairs, Tables, Sofas, Beds, etc.
