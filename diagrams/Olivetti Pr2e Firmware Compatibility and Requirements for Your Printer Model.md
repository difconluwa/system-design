Olivetti Pr2e is a line of specialised printers that can handle various types of documents, such as bank slips, cheques, passports, and tickets. The firmware is the software that controls the printer's functions and features. To ensure optimal performance and compatibility, it is important to keep the firmware updated.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install the latest firmware for your Olivetti Pr2e printer. You will need a computer with an internet connection, a USB cable, and the printer's power cord.

## Step 1: Download the firmware file
 
The first step is to download the firmware file from the official Olivetti website. You can find the download link in the reference section below[^1^]. The file name is PR2E\_Firmware\_1.0.0.zip and it is about 4 MB in size.
 
Once you have downloaded the file, you need to extract it to a folder on your computer. You can use any software that can handle zip files, such as WinZip or 7-Zip. You should see a folder named PR2E\_Firmware\_1.0.0 with two files inside: PR2E\_Firmware\_1.0.0.bin and PR2E\_Firmware\_1.0.0.txt.
 
## Step 2: Connect the printer to the computer
 
The next step is to connect the printer to the computer using a USB cable. Make sure the printer is turned off before connecting it. Plug one end of the cable into the USB port on the back of the printer and the other end into a free USB port on your computer.
 
After connecting the cable, turn on the printer by pressing the power button on the front panel. Wait for a few seconds until the printer initializes and displays "Ready" on the LCD screen.
 
## Step 3: Install the firmware
 
The final step is to install the firmware on the printer using a software tool called PR2E Firmware Updater. You can find this tool in the reference section below[^2^]. The file name is PR2E\_Firmware\_Updater\_1.0.0.exe and it is about 3 MB in size.
 
Once you have downloaded the tool, run it on your computer by double-clicking on it. You should see a window like this:

The tool will automatically detect your printer and show its current firmware version and serial number. If you have more than one Olivetti Pr2e printer connected to your computer, you can select the one you want to update from the drop-down menu.
