The film is also a commentary on the American society and culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s, as seen through the eyes of Thompson and his alter ego Duke. The film depicts the end of the counterculture movement, the failure of the American dream, and the disillusionment and paranoia of a generation that witnessed the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal, and the rise of consumerism. The film also explores themes such as identity, freedom, morality, and madness.
 
The film is a visual feast that showcases Gilliam's distinctive style of filmmaking. He uses a variety of techniques to create a psychedelic atmosphere that matches the mood and mindset of the characters. He employs distorted lenses, exaggerated colors, rapid editing, animation, and special effects to convey the hallucinations and fantasies of Duke and Gonzo. He also uses archival footage, voice-over narration, and direct quotes from Thompson's book to create a sense of authenticity and irony.
 
The film is a challenge to conventional narrative and cinematic conventions. It does not follow a clear plot or structure, but rather jumps from one episode to another with little coherence or continuity. It does not have a clear protagonist or antagonist, but rather presents two anti-heroes who are both likable and despicable. It does not have a clear message or moral, but rather leaves the interpretation up to the viewer. It does not aim to please or entertain, but rather to provoke and disturb.
