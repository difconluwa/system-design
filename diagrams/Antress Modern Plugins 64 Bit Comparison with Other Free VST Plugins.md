Antress Modern Plugins are a collection of free VST effect plugins for Windows that emulate classic outboard processors. They include compressors, equalizers, expanders, limiters, exciters, de-essers, reverbs and more. However, they are only available in 32-bit format, which means they cannot be used directly in 64-bit DAWs.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Antress Modern Plugins in 64-bit DAWs using two methods: bridging and converting. Bridging is a process that allows you to run 32-bit plugins in 64-bit DAWs using a third-party software. Converting is a process that transforms 32-bit plugins into 64-bit plugins using a software development tool.

## Bridging Antress Modern Plugins
 
One of the easiest ways to use Antress Modern Plugins in 64-bit DAWs is to bridge them using a software like [jBridge](https://jstuff.wordpress.com/jbridge/). jBridge is a tool that creates a bridge between 32-bit and 64-bit VST hosts and plugins. It works with most VST hosts and plugins and has several features and options to optimize the performance and compatibility.

To use jBridge, you need to download and install it on your computer. Then, you need to run the jBridger tool that comes with it and select the folder where your Antress Modern Plugins are located. The tool will create bridged versions of the plugins in a new folder. You can then scan this folder in your 64-bit DAW and use the bridged plugins as normal.
 
## Converting Antress Modern Plugins
 
Another way to use Antress Modern Plugins in 64-bit DAWs is to convert them using a software like [Flowstone](https://www.dsprobotics.com/flowstone.html). Flowstone is a graphical programming tool that allows you to create your own VST plugins or modify existing ones. It is based on Synthmaker, which was the original tool used by Antress to create the Modern Plugins.
 
To use Flowstone, you need to download and install it on your computer. Then, you need to open the .osm files that contain the source code of the Antress Modern Plugins. You can find these files in the [Antress Modern Plugins Archive](https://archive.org/details/AntressModernPlugins). Once you open the .osm files in Flowstone, you can export them as 64-bit VST plugins using the Export option in the File menu.
 
### Conclusion
 
Antress Modern Plugins are a great way to add some vintage flavor and character to your mixes. However, they are only available in 32-bit format, which limits their compatibility with modern DAWs. In this article, we showed you how to use Antress Modern Plugins in 64-bit DAWs using two methods: bridging and converting. We hope this helps you enjoy these plugins in your music production.
  
## Reviewing Antress Modern Plugins
 
Antress Modern Plugins have been around for a long time and have gained a lot of popularity among users who are looking for free alternatives to expensive hardware emulations. But how do they sound and compare to the real thing? In this section, we will review some of the most popular Antress Modern Plugins and give our honest opinion on their strengths and weaknesses.
 
### Modern Compressor
 
Modern Compressor is a clone of the SSL G384 compressor, a classic bus compressor that is known for its punchy and transparent sound. It has a simple interface with controls for threshold, ratio, attack, release, side-chain filter, mid/side mode and mix. It also has a gain reduction meter and a power switch.
 
We found Modern Compressor to be a decent plugin for adding some glue and cohesion to your mixes. It can handle drums, guitars, vocals and even the master bus with ease. It has a smooth and clean sound that does not color the signal too much. However, it does not have the same depth and character as the original SSL compressor. It also lacks some features like auto-release and external side-chain input. If you are looking for a more faithful emulation of the SSL compressor, you might want to check out other plugins like Waves SSL G-Master Buss Compressor or IK Multimedia T-RackS Bus Compressor.
 
### Modern Equalizer
 
Modern Equalizer is a clone of the Pultec EQP-1A equalizer, a legendary tube EQ that is famous for its warm and musical sound. It has a simple interface with controls for low frequency, low gain, low peak/shelf mode, mid frequency, mid gain, mid bandwidth, high frequency, high gain, high peak/shelf mode, phase flip, high-pass filter and output. It also has an EQ in/out switch and a mix-ratio control.
 
We found Modern Equalizer to be a nice plugin for adding some sweetness and air to your tracks. It can boost or cut frequencies with a smooth and natural curve that does not sound harsh or artificial. It can enhance vocals, guitars, basses and even drums with its rich and silky sound. However, it does not have the same warmth and saturation as the original Pultec EQ. It also lacks some features like mid/side mode and stereo linking. If you are looking for a more authentic emulation of the Pultec EQ, you might want to check out other plugins like UAD Pultec EQP-1A or Softube Tube-Tech PE 1C.
 
### Modern Expander
 
Modern Expander is a clone of the dbx 160A expander/gate, a versatile dynamics processor that is known for its fast and transparent sound. It has a simple interface with controls for threshold, ratio, knee, range, attack, release and output. It also has a VU meter and a mix control.
 
We found Modern Expander to be a useful plugin for reducing unwanted noise and enhancing transients in your tracks. It can gate drums, guitars, vocals and other instruments with ease. It has a fast and clean sound that does not introduce any distortion or pumping artifacts. However, it does not have the same punch and presence as the original dbx expander/gate. It also lacks some features like side-chain input and stereo linking. If you are looking for a more realistic emulation of the dbx expander/gate, you might want to check out other plugins like Waves dbx 160 or IK Multimedia T-RackS Classic Compressor.
