# How to Play Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors Without a CD
 
Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors is a classic real-time strategy game that has a loyal fan base. However, if you want to play it on your computer without having to insert the CD every time, you might need a no-CD crack. A no-CD crack is a modified version of the game executable file that allows you to run the game without the CD. This can be useful if you have lost or damaged your CD, or if you want to save some disk space.

There are different versions of no-CD cracks available online, but some of them might not work properly or might contain viruses or malware. Therefore, you should be careful when downloading and installing them. In this article, we will show you how to find and use a reliable no-CD crack for Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors version 1.0c, which is the latest official patch for the game.
 
## Step 1: Download the no-CD crack
 
The first step is to download the no-CD crack file from a trusted source. One such source is GameCopyWorld[^1^], which offers various game fixes and trainers for many PC games. You can find the no-CD crack for Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors version 1.0c under the name "Age Of Empires 2: The Conquerors xOmicron v1.1 [ENGLISH] No-CD/Fixed EXE". This file is compatible with the official patch and works with online multiplayer as well.
 
To download the file, you need to click on the floppy disk icon next to the file name and then follow the instructions on the next page. You might need to enter a captcha code or wait for a few seconds before the download starts. The file size is about 893 KB and it is compressed in a ZIP archive.
 
## Step 2: Install the no-CD crack
 
The next step is to install the no-CD crack on your computer. To do this, you need to extract the ZIP archive using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip and then copy the extracted file (age2\_x1.exe) to your game installation folder. The default location for this folder is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II\age2\_x1, but it might vary depending on your system settings.
 
Before you copy the file, you should make a backup of the original file (age2\_x1.exe) in case something goes wrong or you want to restore it later. You can do this by renaming it or moving it to another location. Then, paste the no-CD crack file (age2\_x1.exe) in the same folder and overwrite the existing file if prompted.
