Some of the positive reviews include:
 
- "More than just a sip of fizzy fun, this 3-hour comedy is Jeroboam-sized. Farah Khanâs Happy New Year is an ambitious musical, a love story, an Oceans 11-style crime caper and an ensemble comedy." - Lisa Tsering, The Hollywood Reporter
- "Happy New Year is a rollicking, flamboyant, colourful, witty, action-packed musical bonanza." - Taran Adarsh, Bollywood Hungama
- "Happy New Year is a must watch entertainer for all age groups. It has everything that you expect from a Shah Rukh Khan film." - Meena Iyer, The Times of India

Some of the negative reviews include:

- "Happy New Year is a brightly colored, obnoxiously loud, brutishly simplistic, yet artfully crafted pile of filmi, overly dramatic conventions and references." - Danny Bowes, RogerEbert.com[^1^]
- "Happy New Year is a mess of a film that fails to make any use of its talented cast. It's a tedious and unfunny heist film that relies on cheap gags and recycled jokes." - Anupama Chopra, Hindustan Times
- "Happy New Year is a bloated vanity project that tries to cash in on the star power of Shah Rukh Khan and his cronies. It's a mindless and soulless spectacle that insults the intelligence of the audience." - Rajeev Masand, CNN-IBN

Despite the mixed reviews, Happy New Year was a huge box office success in India and overseas. It broke several records such as the highest opening day collection, the highest opening weekend collection and the fastest film to cross â¹200 crore in India. It also became one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time.
 
Happy New Year is a movie that you will either love or hate. There is no middle ground. It's a movie that celebrates Bollywood in all its glory and madness. It's a movie that will make you laugh, cry and dance along with the characters. It's a movie that will make you happy.
