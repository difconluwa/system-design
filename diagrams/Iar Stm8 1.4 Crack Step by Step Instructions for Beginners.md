In this article, we will show you how to get started with IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8 1.4 and create your first project. We will also introduce some of the features and benefits of using this toolchain for your STM8 development.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8 1.4
 
You can download a free trial version or a size-limited version of IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8 1.4 from the IAR website[^1^]. The trial version is valid for 14 days and allows you to evaluate the full functionality of the toolchain. The size-limited version has no time limit but restricts the code size to 4 KB.
 
After downloading the installer, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to enter your license information or request a trial license during the installation process.
 
## Step 2: Create a New Project
 
After installing IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8 1.4, launch it and select **File > New > Workspace**. A workspace is a container for one or more projects. You can name your workspace as you like and save it in any location.
 
Next, select **Project > Create New Project**. A project is a collection of source files, settings, and build options for a specific target device. You can choose from various project templates or create an empty project. For this example, we will use the **STM8S Standard Peripheral Library Example** template.
 
The project template will create a folder structure with some source files and header files. It will also set up the device configuration, compiler options, linker options, and debugger options for your target device. You can modify these settings as needed by right-clicking on the project name and selecting **Options**.
 
## Step 3: Build and Debug Your Project
 
To build your project, select **Project > Make**. This will compile your source files and link them into an executable file that can be downloaded to your target device. You can view the build output in the **Build** window at the bottom of the IDE.
