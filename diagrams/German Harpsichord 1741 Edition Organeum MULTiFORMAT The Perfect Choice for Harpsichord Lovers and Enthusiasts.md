The harpsichord reached its peak of popularity and development in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it became a staple instrument in many musical genres and styles. The harpsichord was especially favored by composers of the Baroque period, such as Bach, Handel, Scarlatti, Couperin and Rameau. The harpsichord was also used as a solo instrument, as well as in chamber music, orchestral music and opera. The harpsichord was admired for its brilliant and expressive sound, its ability to project over other instruments, and its suitability for complex polyphony and ornamentation.
 
The harpsichord underwent various changes and innovations throughout its history, reflecting different national tastes and preferences. Some of the most important features that distinguished different types of harpsichords were the shape and size of the case, the number and disposition of the keyboards and registers, the tuning system and temperament, the materials and construction of the strings and soundboard, and the decoration and painting of the instrument. Some of the most renowned harpsichord makers were Ruckers in Flanders, Taskin in France, Shudi in England, Zell in Germany, and Cristofori in Italy.
 
The harpsichord declined in popularity in the late 18th century, as the piano emerged as a more versatile and expressive keyboard instrument. The harpsichord was largely forgotten until the 20th century, when a revival of interest in early music led to a rediscovery of its beauty and charm. Modern harpsichordists play both historical instruments and replicas, as well as new instruments inspired by old models. The harpsichord has also inspired contemporary composers to write new music for it, such as Poulenc, Ligeti, Carter and Nyman. The harpsichord is a fascinating instrument that connects us with the past and enriches our musical present.
