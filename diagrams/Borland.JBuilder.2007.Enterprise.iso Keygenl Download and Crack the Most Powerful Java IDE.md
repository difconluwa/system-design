JBuilder 2007 Enterprise is based on the Eclipse platform, which means that it can integrate with other Eclipse-based tools and plugins. It also supports the Open Tools API, which allows developers to extend the functionality of JBuilder with custom components. JBuilder 2007 Enterprise also offers compatibility with previous versions of JBuilder and other Borland products, such as Delphi and C++Builder.
 
One of the main advantages of JBuilder 2007 Enterprise is its support for rapid application development (RAD) and model-driven development (MDD). RAD is a methodology that focuses on delivering software quickly and efficiently by using graphical tools and reusable components. MDD is a methodology that focuses on creating software models that can be automatically transformed into executable code. JBuilder 2007 Enterprise provides tools for both RAD and MDD, such as UML modeling, code generation, visual editing, and live source synchronization.
 
Another advantage of JBuilder 2007 Enterprise is its support for team development and application lifecycle management (ALM). Team development is the process of collaborating with other developers on a shared project. ALM is the process of managing the different stages of a software project, such as planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. JBuilder 2007 Enterprise provides tools for both team development and ALM, such as version control, project management, code review, testing automation, performance analysis, and deployment automation.
